# PLAsTiCC Astronomy Challenge

This repo contains code relevant to the PLAsTiCC astronomy challenge, hosted on Kaggle. The goal is to classify time-varying astronomical sources using simulated LSST data.

You need to download that data yourself from the Kaggle website, it is too big to host on GitHub.
